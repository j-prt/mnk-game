# Tic-Tac-Oh!

Simple CLI implementation of the [M, N, K style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game) of games, where players win by achieving a K-streak of matching symbols on an M x N size grid. Currently the game accommodates grids with M or N <= 15 with K <= 15. Two-player only. Inspired by games like [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) and [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku).
